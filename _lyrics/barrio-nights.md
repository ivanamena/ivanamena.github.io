Man I came up on the east Side
El Barrio, we blowing smoke while we G ride
Dominicana so I flow uptown, Washington Heights Dimelo, Tato ,You Know
And where we from nobody sleeps no, we hustle hard to snatch it from you
You wont eat no
Not if the shooters around
Keep your eyes sharp and an ear to the ground
And you’ll never see us coming
Your eyes fixed on our swag so hard you miss it when we strum in
Fall through, squaded like the mob do
That’s why you hate it when you’re girl’s with our crew
And babygirl I peeped you, 
Watching me intent to scheme off all that we do
But there aint nothing I can teach you
Theres gotta be a sauce within that you can freak to

See I was born in it sworn in it
Aunt Maybeline can’t paint your mug to last you 4 minutes
And watch your mouth come correct, I keep my hittas repping from the east to the west
Your boots too cooked to step up
Think you could hold your weight well boy poke your chest out
Nah, stay over there…we got miles left to spare, we got no room to fail

*SCENE FROM ‘HARLEM NIGHTS”*

Don’t misunderstand, my momma taught me bout Cliqulot and France
She taught me bout things like how to withstand
How to politely say “boy kiss my ass”
Im from an island left with little oats
Moved to an island where we go for broke
Merengue music keeps the tourist woke
But joke’s on you cause we here to envoke….

Man I told you where I’m from tho,
Aint got no time to remind you just why we’re so dope
Bring your cousins to town
Apparently we got it no tia’s around

No coquitos on the corner
Botanica keeps calling us to say theyre more broke
Put your prayers in town, you gotta put em all the way all around

Yemaya, ven aca
Dame una limpieza aunque sea por de tras
Necesito que me traigas uno mas
Y (el) la sol y la luna por demas
Dame lo que puedes a (que) decir
Dime lo que tienes que decir

Ay un diosito que me puede abrir, una puerta para yo salir, salir?

East Harlem, you raised me
From your broke down halls to your pristine streets
Langston Hughes to Maya Angelou, Zora Neal Hurston to Tito Puente Blues
Something’s different now, ma you changed up
I see wingtips now, no more timbs cuffed
Buildings higher, no more hood supplier
Gentrify my whole hood, I wont be the buyer
