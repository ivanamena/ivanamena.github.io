<span class="dropcap">B</span>orn as a native to New York City in the late 80s with parents hailing from the Dominican Republic, Ivana Mena grew up on equal parts Biggie Smalls and Juan Luis Guerra. By the age of 7, Ivana found a creative outlet for her gift of song when she joined The Young Peopleâ€™s Chorus of NYC. During her time with the chorus she gained the opportunity to travel and perform in places like Germany, Japan and eventually singing solo at Carnegie Hall and Central Park Summer Stage. Years later after graduating Newbury College of Massachusetts with a B.S in Fashion Merchandising, Ivana traded her East Harlem home for Downtown, Los Angeles. After networking in various studios, she began recording her first EP The Jiggy Tape. Vol.1. The project embodied sounds of the Golden era of Hip-hop mixed with sultry R&B soul and gained the attention of industry figures like Roc Nation's Cipha Sounds, Hot 97's Peter Rosenberg, Revolt TV and many more. With 2018 plans to release her debut studio album, Ivana and her company [The Agnyc](https://www.instagram.com/the.agnyc/) are creating the music she's always dreamed of on her own terms.
